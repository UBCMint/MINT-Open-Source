## Overview
The data parsers read a specific data file format and convert it into a readable format specifically for further visualizations and processing. Each parser is kept within the following folder at the root of the repository:
``` shell
"\dataFormatParsers\parsers"
```
This folder only contains data parsers and should not contain anything else.
